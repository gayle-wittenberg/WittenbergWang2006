## Wittenberg and Wang 2006: Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity Data

> This repository makes availale the data to regenerate Figures 1d, 3e, and 4d from [Wittenberg and Wang 2006](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/26/24/6610.full.pdf).

> - Data can be read into R in the WittenbergWang2006.RData file. 
> - A corresonding WittenbergWang2006.mat file is provided for Matlab users.
> - For each figure, the synapse strength (dW), standard error (sterr) and timing interval (dt) are provided.
> - In figures 3 and 4, "dt=0" corresponds to the time of the second action potential, as indicated in the manuscript.
> - An example usage of the data to regenerate figures is provided in WittenbergWang2006.R
